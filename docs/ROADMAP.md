# Roadmap

High-level view of how raw ideas become shipped features. This is intentionally lightweight; deeper specs live in ad-hoc design docs when needed.

## Stages
1. Idea (in `docs/IDEAS.md`).
2. Specification (problem statement + acceptance + rough data structures).
3. Planned (slotted for a target version).
4. In Progress (actively being implemented on `main` or a feature branch).
5. Shipped (released in a tagged version, reflected in `CHANGELOG.md`).

## Promotion Criteria
- Clear user problem articulated.
- No simpler existing solution already in the addon.
- Complexity fits within upcoming version scope.
- Low coupling or justified core changes.
- Acceptance tests bullet list written.

## Version Buckets (Tentative)
### 0.3 (Shipped)

- ChatFilters module (system chat suppression) initial delivery.
- ChatFilters enhancements (0.3.1–0.3.2): money loot line suppression, login welcome + first automatic /played suppression, live session stats refresh, hidden advanced hook toggles.

### 0.4 (Next)

- Aura Blacklist Import/Export (evaluation / spec).
- Frame Scale Memory utility.
- Potential foreground FPS cap management (extension of BackgroundFPSFix if demand confirmed).
- ChatFilters: Loot item quality filtering (evaluation) – optional suppression below threshold with quest/gathering exceptions.

### 0.5

- DataBroker Bridge (conditional loading).
- Performance Profiler Micro-Panel (depends on validation of CPU cost benefits).

### 1.0 Goal Themes

- Stable API for module lifecycle helpers.
- Comprehensive localization coverage (at least 3 extra locales).
- Export/import for key module profiles.
- Polished documentation & in-game help panel.
- Mature "Tweaks" cluster (background/foreground FPS, optional CPU sampler, safe CVAR presets).

## Tracking

When moving an item forward, reference its short title in commits, e.g.:

```text
feat(aura-filters): add blacklist export serialization
```

Then add the change under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Deferral / Dropping

If an idea repeatedly stalls (e.g. >3 versions), note a reason instead of silently removing:

```text
Dropped: DataBroker Bridge (overlap with external LDB plugins, minimal extra value)
```

## Notes

- Keep roadmap flexible: actual delivery may shift if bugs / regressions appear.
- Favor small increments over large monolithic drops.
