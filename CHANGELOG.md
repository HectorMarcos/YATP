# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres (aspirationally) to Semantic Versioning once it reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed

- **NamePlates**: Quest icon cache system causing incorrect display
  - Icons not appearing when they should (stale cache)
  - Icons appearing on mobs without quests (name-based matching instead of unit ID)
  - Icons not updating after quest completion (no re-scan)
  - Solution: Removed cache system, now scans tooltip in real-time with 0.5s periodic updates
  - Icons now update immediately (<0.5s) when quests are completed or abandoned

- **NamePlates**: Border blocking system overwriting custom target border
  - Black border system was forcing ALL nameplates to black including target
  - Target's custom colored border (yellow/configurable) was being replaced by black
  - Solution: ForceBlackBordersOnAllNameplates() now skips current target
  - BlockNameplateBorderGlow() hook checks if nameplate is target before forcing black
  - OnTargetChanged() forces previous target back to black when switching

- **NamePlates**: Lua 5.1 compatibility error
  - Error: "'=' expected near 'continue'"
  - WoW 3.3.5 uses Lua 5.1 which doesn't support goto/continue statements
  - Solution: Replaced goto-continue pattern with conditional if-not structure

### Changed

- **NamePlates**: Removed debug spam from threat system
  - Eliminated "[YATP Threat] Skipping threat color for X - mouseover highlight is active" messages
  - System now operates silently without chat spam

### Technical Notes

- Quest icon system now uses direct unit ID matching instead of name-based lookup
- Periodic OnUpdate frame (0.5s interval) keeps quest icons synchronized
- Target border uses custom 4-texture frame overlay for better visibility (reverted from native border experiment)

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- **NamePlates**: Custom Quest Icon System (YATP Enhancement)
  - Displays custom quest objective icons on nameplates for NPCs you need to kill or interact with
  - Automatically scans nameplate tooltips (without requiring mouseover) to detect quest objectives
  - Looks for quest progress patterns like '0/6' or '5/10' and only shows icon when objective is incomplete
  - Icons automatically disappear when quest objective is complete (e.g., '6/6') or quest is abandoned
  - Replaces unreliable native Ascension_NamePlates quest icons with robust custom implementation
  - Configurable icon size (12-48px), position (TOP/BOTTOM/LEFT/RIGHT), and X/Y offsets (-50 to +50px)
  - Hidden tooltip scanning system for efficient quest detection without interfering with gameplay
  - Native quest icons automatically hidden (alpha 0) when custom system enabled, restored (alpha 1) when disabled

### Technical Improvements

- **NamePlates**: Implemented comprehensive EventRegistry callback system for nameplate tracking
  - `NamePlateDriver.UnitFrameCreated` callback stores frames by `_unit` identifier for later retrieval
  - `NamePlateManager.UnitAdded` callback processes nameplates with proper timing delays (0.15-0.2s)
  - `NamePlateManager.UnitRemoved` callback cleans up quest tracking data
  - Manual frame storage system replaces non-existent `C_NamePlateManager.GetNamePlateForUnit()` API
  - Dual storage keys: both `_unit` (nameplate1, nameplate2) and `UnitFrame.unit` for compatibility

- **NamePlates**: Quest icon architecture with race condition handling
  - Hidden tooltip (`YATPQuestScanTooltip`) created once on module init for efficient scanning
  - Frame-by-frame tracking via `questTrackedUnits` table (unitID â†’ {name, hasQuest})
  - Frame retrieval with retry logic handles timing between frame creation and unit assignment
  - High frame strata/level (HIGH strata, level 100) ensures icons display above other elements
  - Dynamic position/size updates apply immediately when settings changed

- **NamePlates**: Native icon control system
  - `SetNativeQuestIconAlpha()` function controls visibility of Ascension_NamePlates quest icons
  - Batch update function `UpdateAllNativeQuestIconAlphas()` applies alpha to all active nameplates
  - Alpha values: 0 = hidden (custom icons active), 1 = visible (custom icons disabled)
  - Preserves native icons (doesn't delete) for seamless toggle between systems

- **NamePlates**: Neutral NPCs now correctly maintain their yellow color
  - Fixed `ResetHealthBarColor()`, `ResetNameplateColors()`, and `ClearAllThreatColors()` functions
  - These functions were forcing red (1,0,0) or green (0,1,0) colors on all units
  - Now correctly preserve game's natural faction-based coloring system:
    * Red for hostile enemies
    * Yellow for neutral NPCs
    * Green for friendly units
  - Reset functions no longer call `SetStatusBarColor()` or `SetTextColor()`
  - Game's default nameplate system handles color restoration naturally

- **NamePlates**: Missing localization entry for mouseover highlight description
  - Added English translation for "Highlight the health bar when mousing over non-target nameplates. Uses a white tint effect (50% mix) for subtle visibility."
  - Resolves AceLocale-3.0 missing entry error message

### Technical Improvements

- **NamePlates**: Threat system now implements defense-in-depth approach with multiple verification layers
  - Group status checked at multiple points (event handlers, update functions, combat handlers)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- NamePlates: comprehensive integration module for Ascension NamePlates addon providing status monitoring, loading controls, and direct configuration access through YATP's Interface Hub.
- NamePlates: independent category with tab-based structure replicating the original addon's organization (Status, General, Friendly, Enemy, Personal tabs).
- NamePlates: Enemy Target tab with specialized options for targeted enemy nameplates including enhanced visibility, custom highlighting, borders, and health display formats.
- NamePlates: embedded configuration panel with the most commonly used settings directly accessible within YATP interface without needing to open the original addon configuration.
- NamePlates: real-time option synchronization with the original addon allowing seamless configuration changes that immediately affect the nameplates.
- NamePlates: adaptive interface that shows configuration tabs only when the addon is loaded and available.
- NamePlates: YATP-specific enhancements for enemy targets including highlight effects, enhanced borders, and flexible health text formatting.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-XX-XX

### Fixed
- **Enemy Target Tab**: Removed non-functional custom options that don't exist in the Ascension NamePlates addon
- **Real Options Only**: Enemy Target tab now only includes Target Scale, the only real target-specific option from the original addon
- **Documentation**: Updated to accurately reflect available options vs custom implementations

### Changed
- **Enemy Target Tab**: Simplified to focus on working Target Scale option and information about other available settings
- **Localization**: Updated Enemy Target tab text to reflect actual functionality
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed placeholder functions for non-existent features (UpdateTargetHighlight, UpdateTargetBorder, etc.)

### Added
- **Better Information**: Enemy Target tab now provides clear guidance on where to find other nameplate customization options
- **Technical Notes**: Added explanation of what target-specific options are actually available in the base addon

### Documentation
- **ENEMY_TARGET_REAL_OPTIONS.md**: Comprehensive documentation of actual vs non-existent options
- **Honest Interface**: Tab now provides functional options rather than placeholders that don't work

## [1.0.2] - 2024-XX-XX

### Added

- QuickConfirm: bind-on-pickup (BOP) loot auto-confirmation feature with comprehensive detection via `LOOT_BIND` which value and text pattern fallback ("will bind it to you", "bind it to you", "looting").
- QuickConfirm: extended retry scheduling system to handle both transmog and BOP loot confirmations with mode-specific logic.
- XPRepBar: animated spark indicator showing current XP progress position with configurable show/hide toggle.
- XPRepBar: enhanced max level detection with `YATP_GetEffectiveMaxLevel()` function supporting multiple client builds and expansion levels.
- Localization: complete English and Spanish translations for new BOP loot functionality.

### Changed

- QuickConfirm: updated module description to include both transmog and bind-on-pickup loot functionality.
- XPRepBar: improved rested XP overlay positioning - now correctly starts at current XP position instead of bar beginning.
- Error handling: standardized error messages across modules with proper formatting and red color coding.

### Fixed

- XPRepBar: better handling of various client builds and expansion levels with improved error handling for edge cases.
- Code quality: replaced generic `print()` statements with properly formatted `DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage()` calls across multiple modules.

### Completed Features

- Removed completed "QuickConfirm: Auto-accept world loot (BOP)" idea from IDEAS.md as it has been successfully implemented and tested.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- ChatBubbles: standardized "Enable Module" toggle (previous wording "Hide Chat Bubbles" could be ambiguous).
- XPRepBar: new "Enable Module" master toggle (hides frames & unregisters events when disabled).
- Core: confirmation dialog for /reload after toggling any module enable state (YES / CANCEL).
- All modules: enable toggle tooltips now indicate a /reload is recommended for a fully clean apply.
- PlayerAuraFilter: new separated module for name-based buff hiding (starts empty; no migration of legacy PlayerAuras list).

### Changed

- Unified enable/disable pattern to consistently use AceAddon `:Enable()` / `:Disable()` across modules (Hotkeys, QuickConfirm, etc.).
- UX consistency: post-toggle reload prompt avoids confusion about partial state without UI reload.
- PlayerAuras: now layout-only (scale, rows, growth, sort, duration font). Filtering logic extracted to PlayerAuraFilter.
- Localization: remaining Spanish comments in PlayerAuras translated to English for repository consistency.

### Removed

- ChatBubbles: Aggressive Scan toggle and scan interval option.
- QuickConfirm: legacy exit watcher & auto-exit logic (now focused narrowly on transmog confirmations only).
- Hotkeys: temporary target-change burst refresh system (replaced by steady timer + immediate recolor on adjustments).
- ChatFilters: obsolete loot money filtering option (redundant with base client; legacy profile key now ignored).
- PlayerAuras: old `knownBuffs` keys and filter UI (superseded by the new PlayerAuraFilter module). Prior hidden list data intentionally discarded.

### Fixed

- Hotkeys: changing interval slider triggers immediate one-pass recolor for fast visual feedback.
- Scheduler: updated to ignore removed option keys gracefully (no dangling references / errors).
- Locale: added missing keys to eliminate AceLocale runtime warnings.

### Temporarily Disabled Modules

- PlayerAuras: forcibly disabled this release pending review of recent aura frame/API behavior; Blizzard default layout in use.
- PlayerAuraFilter: forcibly disabled (filter logic suspended) to avoid confusion while layout module is inactive.

### Internal / Maintenance

- Hotkeys task refactored to dynamic interval function (future adaptive tuning hook).
- Locales cleaned of deprecated keys to prevent stale UI clutter; added missing runtime keys.
- README updated to reflect module split and temporary suspension notice for aura modules.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-10-08

Changed:

- QuickConfirm: scope reduced to only auto-confirm full client exit (QUIT / CONFIRM_EXIT). It no longer auto-confirms logout / CAMP dialogs.

Removed:

- QuickConfirm: detection of CAMP (logout) which id, textual cue "camp", "leave world", and logout countdown phrases ("seconds until logout").

Internal / Maintenance:

- Adjusted exit text cue list to minimal set ("exit", "quit") to prevent accidental logout confirmation in multi-locale setups.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-08

Added:

- ChatFilters: automatic suppression of first login/reload /played dump (manual /played remains visible).
- IDEAS: added concept for loot item quality filtering (threshold + quest/gathering exceptions).

Changed:

- ChatFilters: consolidated advanced toggles (AddMessage hook, /played suppression options) into hidden defaults; user-facing option now a single "Suppress Login Welcome Lines" toggle.
- README: updated ChatFilters module summary to reflect current behavior (money lines, login spam, first /played suppression).

Fixed:

- ChatFilters: dynamic Session Stats now refresh via throttled AceConfigRegistry notifications; first /played suppression increments login spam counter.

Removed:

- ChatFilters: exposed UI options for AddMessage hook and /played fine-grain settings (retained internally for compatibility).

Internal / Maintenance:

- Refactored time played hook to a narrow proxy around ChatFrame_DisplayTimePlayed with first-call suppression logic and safe restore on module disable.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-07

Additions:

- BackgroundFPSFix module (Extras > Tweaks): provides a configurable background framerate cap (`/console maxfpsbk`) with restore-on-disable behavior and slider up to 240 FPS (0 = no override). Replaces earlier experimental embedding attempt inside WAAdiFixes.

Changes:

- TOC: added `modules/backgroundfpsfix.lua` entry.
- README: documented Tweaks panel presence (Background FPS Fix).
- IDEAS: moved "Background FPS Limit Toggle" to Historical as shipped.

Internal / Maintenance:

- Refactored WAAdiFixes to remove temporary background FPS logic.
- Introduced Tweaks group under Extras for future small performance toggles.

## [0.3] - 2025-10-07

Added:

- ChatFilters module (Quality of Life): suppresses repetitive system error spam ("Interface action failed because of an AddOn" / UI Error variants) with substring + token matching, color code stripping, optional diagnostic logging.

Changed:

- README: documented new ChatFilters module.
- TOC: version bump to 0.3.

Fixed:

- Locale: added missing keys (Debug Mode, verbose debug description, ChatFilters labels) eliminating AceLocale missing entry warnings.

Internal / Maintenance:

- ChatFilters logic includes extensible placeholders for future pattern list & summary counters (currently hidden advanced toggles).

## [0.2] - 2025-10-07

Added:

- Global Debug Mode toggle under `YATP > Extras` controlling verbose output for all modules.
- Consolidated debug helper API: `YATP:IsDebug()` and `YATP:Debug(msg)`.
- Loot Roll Info module: debug simulation commands `/lriblizz`, `/lripop`, `/lrihide`.

Changed:

- LootRollInfo: migrated from standalone script; counters & tooltips refined; fallback English pattern parsing added.
- LootRollInfo: button counter placement unified (top-right) and resilient button lookup.
- QuickConfirm: now uses global debug mode; removed per-module debug toggle and `/qcdebug` command.
- Template module: removed per-module debug toggle; now references global debug.

Removed:

- Per-module `debug` toggles in LootRollInfo, QuickConfirm, Template.
- Obsolete duplicate root `config.lua` (already documented in TOC Notes-ESMX).

Internal / Maintenance:

- Added this CHANGELOG.md file.
- Standardized internal debug print prefix formatting.
