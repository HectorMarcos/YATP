- **Hotkeys**: Optimized color caching system to minimize unnecessary `SetVertexColor` calls, improving performance.
- **Hotkeys**: Simplified configuration interface by removing unused range display modes, keeping only the full button tinting mode.
- **Hotkeys**: Range check interval now fixed at 0.2 seconds per button for consistent responsiveness matching game engine tooltip updates.
- **QuickConfirm**: Optimized retry attempts (3) and retry intervals (0.2s) for better performance and reliability.

### Changed

- **QuestTracker**: Removed all legacy quest sorting functionality - quests now maintain natural WoW order with only Path to Ascension repositioning.
- **QuestTracker**: Simplified auto-tracking to two clear modes: "All Quests" and "By Zone" with mutual exclusivity and auto-fallback.
- **QuestTracker**: Configuration interface streamlined from 12+ options to 8 essential, working options.
- **Hotkeys**: Removed user-adjustable update interval slider in favor of optimal fixed timing.
- **Hotkeys**: Removed scheduler dependency for range checks, each button now manages its own timer independently.
- **QuickConfirm**: Hidden advanced configuration options (retry attempts, retry interval, AdiBags refresh delay) from UI while maintaining configurable defaults internally.

### Fixed

- **QuestTracker**: Resolved WatchFrame corruption issues that occurred when toggling "Show Quest Levels" and "Color Code by Difficulty" options mid-session.
- **QuestTracker**: Fixed duplicate quest level prefixes that could appear after multiple toggle operations.
- **QuestTracker**: Eliminated conflicting legacy cleanup functions (`RemoveQuestLevels`, `ShowQuestLevels`, etc.) that caused state management issues.
- **QuestTracker**: Fixed text outline thickness defaulting to "Normal" consistently across all UI elements.
- **QuestTracker**: Resolved issues with quest reordering logic interfering with native WoW quest tracking behavior.
- **Hotkeys**: Fixed range indicator lag that occurred with many active buttons due to batching delays.
- **Hotkeys**: Resolved delayed range updates when changing targets or switching action bars.
- **QuickConfirm**: Fixed AdiBags refresh to use proper `SendMessage('AdiBags_FiltersChanged')` API for reliable bag updates.

### Removed

- **QuestTracker**: All legacy debugging commands (`/qttest`, `/qtfix`, `/qtdash`, `/qtdebug`, `/qtanalyze`) and their associated functions (`TestFunction`, `DebugDashAnalysis`, etc.).
- **QuestTracker**: Removed unused configuration options: `showProgressPercent`, `compactMode`, `highlightNearbyObjectives`, `showQuestIcons` (never implemented or non-functional).
- **QuestTracker**: Legacy dual-system functions: `RemoveQuestLevels()`, `ShowQuestLevels()`, `ApplyDifficultyColors()` replaced by unified processing.
- **QuestTracker**: Complex quest sorting system including `SortQuestsByLevel()`, `ReorderWatchFrameLines()`, `ApplyZoneFilter()` and related utilities.
- **QuestTracker**: Unused variables: `savedWatchFrameContent`, `savedFrameProperties`, `isApplyingLevels`, `lastProcessedQuests`, `nearbyObjectives`.
- **QuestTracker**: Analysis and debugging functions: `AnalyzeWatchFrameStructure()`, `FindQuestTitleInWatchFrame()`, `GetCleanText()`, `ShowProgressPercentages()`.
- **QuestTracker**: Text outline thickness configuration - now always uses "Normal" thickness when enabled.

### Technical Improvements

- **QuestTracker**: Reduced codebase from 2153 to 1638 lines (24% reduction) while maintaining all core functionality.
- **QuestTracker**: Implemented dash-based detection system using `dash.text == "-"` pattern for 100% accurate quest title vs objective identification.
- **QuestTracker**: Unified all text enhancements into single `ApplyAllTextEnhancements()` function eliminating race conditions and duplicate processing.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-XX-XX

### Added

- QuickConfirm: bind-on-pickup (BOP) loot auto-confirmation feature with comprehensive detection via `LOOT_BIND` which value and text pattern fallback ("will bind it to you", "bind it to you", "looting").
- QuickConfirm: extended retry scheduling system to handle both transmog and BOP loot confirmations with mode-specific logic.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- ChatBubbles: standardized "Enable Module" toggle (previous wording "Hide Chat Bubbles" could be ambiguous).
- XPRepBar: new "Enable Module" master toggle (hides frames & unregisters events when disabled).
- Core: confirmation dialog for /reload after toggling any module enable state (YES / CANCEL).
- All modules: enable toggle tooltips now indicate a /reload is recommended for a fully clean apply.
- PlayerAuraFilter: new separated module for name-based buff hiding (starts empty; no migration of legacy PlayerAuras list).

### Changed

- Unified enable/disable pattern to consistently use AceAddon `:Enable()` / `:Disable()` across modules (Hotkeys, QuickConfirm, etc.).
- UX consistency: post-toggle reload prompt avoids confusion about partial state without UI reload.
- PlayerAuras: now layout-only (scale, rows, growth, sort, duration font). Filtering logic extracted to PlayerAuraFilter.
- Localization: remaining Spanish comments in PlayerAuras translated to English for repository consistency.

### Removed

- ChatBubbles: Aggressive Scan toggle and scan interval option.
- QuickConfirm: legacy exit watcher & auto-exit logic (now focused narrowly on transmog confirmations only).
- Hotkeys: temporary target-change burst refresh system (replaced by steady timer + immediate recolor on adjustments).
- ChatFilters: obsolete loot money filtering option (redundant with base client; legacy profile key now ignored).
- PlayerAuras: old `knownBuffs` keys and filter UI (superseded by the new PlayerAuraFilter module). Prior hidden list data intentionally discarded.

### Fixed

- Hotkeys: changing interval slider triggers immediate one-pass recolor for fast visual feedback.
- Scheduler: updated to ignore removed option keys gracefully (no dangling references / errors).
- Locale: added missing keys to eliminate AceLocale runtime warnings.

### Temporarily Disabled Modules

- PlayerAuras: forcibly disabled this release pending review of recent aura frame/API behavior; Blizzard default layout in use.
- PlayerAuraFilter: forcibly disabled (filter logic suspended) to avoid confusion while layout module is inactive.

### Internal / Maintenance

- Hotkeys task refactored to dynamic interval function (future adaptive tuning hook).
- Locales cleaned of deprecated keys to prevent stale UI clutter; added missing runtime keys.
- README updated to reflect module split and temporary suspension notice for aura modules.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-10-08

Changed:

- QuickConfirm: scope reduced to only auto-confirm full client exit (QUIT / CONFIRM_EXIT). It no longer auto-confirms logout / CAMP dialogs.

Removed:

- QuickConfirm: detection of CAMP (logout) which id, textual cue "camp", "leave world", and logout countdown phrases ("seconds until logout").

Internal / Maintenance:

- Adjusted exit text cue list to minimal set ("exit", "quit") to prevent accidental logout confirmation in multi-locale setups.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-08

- IDEAS: added concept for loot item quality filtering (threshold + quest/gathering exceptions).

Changed:

- ChatFilters: consolidated advanced toggles (AddMessage hook, /played suppression options) into hidden defaults; user-facing option now a single "Suppress Login Welcome Lines" toggle.
- README: updated ChatFilters module summary to reflect current behavior (money lines, login spam, first /played suppression).

Fixed:

- ChatFilters: dynamic Session Stats now refresh via throttled AceConfigRegistry notifications; first /played suppression increments login spam counter.

Removed:

- ChatFilters: exposed UI options for AddMessage hook and /played fine-grain settings (retained internally for compatibility).

Internal / Maintenance:

- Refactored time played hook to a narrow proxy around ChatFrame_DisplayTimePlayed with first-call suppression logic and safe restore on module disable.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-07

Additions:

- BackgroundFPSFix module (Extras > Tweaks): provides a configurable background framerate cap (`/console maxfpsbk`) with restore-on-disable behavior and slider up to 240 FPS (0 = no override). Replaces earlier experimental embedding attempt inside WAAdiFixes.

Changes:

- TOC: added `modules/backgroundfpsfix.lua` entry.
- README: documented Tweaks panel presence (Background FPS Fix).
- IDEAS: moved "Background FPS Limit Toggle" to Historical as shipped.

- Introduced Tweaks group under Extras for future small performance toggles.

## [0.3] - 2025-10-07

Added:

- ChatFilters module (Quality of Life): suppresses repetitive system error spam ("Interface action failed because of an AddOn" / UI Error variants) with substring + token matching, color code stripping, optional diagnostic logging.

Changed:

- README: documented new ChatFilters module.
- TOC: version bump to 0.3.

Fixed:

- Locale: added missing keys (Debug Mode, verbose debug description, ChatFilters labels) eliminating AceLocale missing entry warnings.

## [0.2] - 2025-10-07

Added:

- Global Debug Mode toggle under `YATP > Extras` controlling verbose output for all modules.
- Consolidated debug helper API: `YATP:IsDebug()` and `YATP:Debug(msg)`.

Changed:

- LootRollInfo: migrated from standalone script; counters & tooltips refined; fallback English pattern parsing added.
- LootRollInfo: button counter placement unified (top-right) and resilient button lookup.
- QuickConfirm: now uses global debug mode; removed per-module debug toggle and `/qcdebug` command.
- Template module: removed per-module debug toggle; now references global debug.

Removed:

- Per-module `debug` toggles in LootRollInfo, QuickConfirm, Template.
- Obsolete duplicate root `config.lua` (already documented in TOC Notes-ESMX).

Internal / Maintenance:

- Added this CHANGELOG.md file.
