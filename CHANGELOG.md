## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- ChatFilters: automatic suppression of first login/reload /played dump (manual /played remains visible).
- IDEAS: added concept for loot item quality filtering (threshold + quest/gathering exceptions).

### Changed

- ChatFilters: consolidated advanced toggles (AddMessage hook, /played suppression options) into hidden defaults; user-facing option now a single "Suppress Login Welcome Lines" toggle.
- README: updated ChatFilters module summary to reflect current behavior (money lines, login spam, first /played suppression).

### Fixed

- ChatFilters: dynamic Session Stats now refresh via throttled AceConfigRegistry notifications; first /played suppression increments login spam counter.

### Removed

- ChatFilters: exposed UI options for AddMessage hook and /played fine-grain settings (retained internally for compatibility).

### Internal / Maintenance

- Refactored time played hook to a narrow proxy around ChatFrame_DisplayTimePlayed with first-call suppression logic and safe restore on module disable.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-07

### 0.3.1 Additions

- BackgroundFPSFix module (Extras > Tweaks): provides a configurable background framerate cap (`/console maxfpsbk`) with restore-on-disable behavior and slider up to 240 FPS (0 = no override). Replaces earlier experimental embedding attempt inside WAAdiFixes.

### 0.3.1 Changes

- TOC: added `modules/backgroundfpsfix.lua` entry.
- README: documented Tweaks panel presence (Background FPS Fix).
- IDEAS: moved "Background FPS Limit Toggle" to Historical as shipped.

### 0.3.1 Internal / Maintenance

- Refactored WAAdiFixes to remove temporary background FPS logic.
- Introduced Tweaks group under Extras for future small performance toggles.

## [0.3] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- ChatFilters module (Quality of Life): suppresses repetitive system error spam ("Interface action failed because of an AddOn" / UI Error variants) with substring + token matching, color code stripping, optional diagnostic logging.

### Changed
- README: documented new ChatFilters module.
- TOC: version bump to 0.3.

### Fixed
- Locale: added missing keys (Debug Mode, verbose debug description, ChatFilters labels) eliminating AceLocale missing entry warnings.

### Internal / Maintenance
- ChatFilters logic includes extensible placeholders for future pattern list & summary counters (currently hidden advanced toggles).

## [0.2] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- Global Debug Mode toggle under `YATP > Extras` controlling verbose output for all modules.
- Consolidated debug helper API: `YATP:IsDebug()` and `YATP:Debug(msg)`.
- Loot Roll Info module: debug simulation commands `/lriblizz`, `/lripop`, `/lrihide`.

### Changed
- LootRollInfo: migrated from standalone script; counters & tooltips refined; fallback English pattern parsing added.
- LootRollInfo: button counter placement unified (top-right) and resilient button lookup.
- QuickConfirm: now uses global debug mode; removed per-module debug toggle and `/qcdebug` command.
- Template module: removed per-module debug toggle; now references global debug.

### Removed
- Per-module `debug` toggles in LootRollInfo, QuickConfirm, Template.
- Obsolete duplicate root `config.lua` (already documented in TOC Notes-ESMX).

### Internal / Maintenance
- Added this CHANGELOG.md file.
- Standardized internal debug print prefix formatting.
