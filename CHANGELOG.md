## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- ChatBubbles: standardized "Enable Module" toggle (previous wording "Hide Chat Bubbles" could be ambiguous).
- XPRepBar: new "Enable Module" master toggle (hides frames & unregisters events when disabled).
- Core: confirmation dialog for /reload after toggling any module enable state (YES / CANCEL).
- All modules: enable toggle tooltips now indicate a /reload is recommended for a fully clean apply.
